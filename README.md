# TooExpensiveFix
Have you ever had hundreds of levels, wanted to enchant an item, but when you went to put it into an anvil, it just said "Too Expensive!"? Do you wish this stupid "feature" should be removed from the game? Well so do I, so that's exactly what I did! The new limit for enchantments is now level 21862 (1 lower than the level limit to prevent errors or glitches), which pretty much nobody will ever get to legitimately. This plugin also makes all re-name cost to just one level, because simply re-naming an item (you know, an aesthetic only change), should not cost you a fortune.

PLEASE READ THE PARAGRAPH BELOW!!!!!!​

The actual "Too Expensive!" text CANNOT be removed, however you are still able to do the enchantment if you have enough levels. This unfortunately means you can't see the amount of levels you need to do the enchant. This cannot be fixed due to Bukkit API's limitations without some complicated, messy code that I'm not gonna bother with. Also, for those using Geyser, bedrock users cannot take advantage of any of this due to bedrock client limitations. There is nothing i can do about that.
